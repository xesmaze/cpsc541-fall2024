        "Nested cross-validation is used when tuning hyperparameters in addition to assessing model performance. It consists of two loops: an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning and an outer loop for assessing the model's performance. This method ensures that hyperparameters are tuned without biasing the model's performance estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Process:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. In the outer loop, split the data into k folds for model evaluation.\n",
        "2. In the inner loop, use another cross-validation process (usually k-fold) to tune the hyperparameters on the training set of the outer fold.\n",
        "3. Train the model with the optimal hyperparameters on the inner loop and evaluate it on the validation fold in the outer loop.\n",

It is particularly useful when the theoretical distribution of test statistics is unknown or difficult to derive.\n",
        "\n",

If the observed statistic lies far in the tails, this suggests poor fit.\n",
