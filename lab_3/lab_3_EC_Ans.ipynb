        "The polynomial model includes additional terms that capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, such as temperature squared and interaction terms like light × CO₂. This allows the model to fit the data slightly better by accounting for curvature and interactions that the linear model cannot capture. However, since the original data was generated using a linear relationship, the improvement is minimal.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding non-linear terms allows the model to capture more complex patterns in the data. For example, the effect of temperature on photosynthesis might not be strictly linear; photosynthesis rates could increase with temperature up to an optimal point and then decrease. The squared term for temperature helps model this curvature, providing a better fit if such a non-linear relationship exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Based on the results, should we prefer the linear or the polynomial model? Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the polynomial model shows a marginal improvement in MSE and R² values. However, the improvement is minimal, and the increased complexity of the polynomial model may not justify its use. If model simplicity and interpretability are important, the linear model may be preferred. If capturing potential non-linear relationships is crucial, and the slight performance gain is valuable, the polynomial model could be chosen."
